## My process

The entire project took me 7.5h to complete, including responsive web design for desktop, tablet and mobile views. For the first time I used @mixin for buttons in SCSS. This is a useful solution, reducing the amount of code in SCSS. The project did not cause me any difficulties.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS 
- SCSS 
- Flexbox
